# Pokémon List App
A React Native project built to explore Pokémon data using the [**PokeAPI**](https://pokeapi.co/).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/denis-konakov/demo-poke-list.git
cd demo-poke-list
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

NPM:
```bash
npm install
```

Cocoapods:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is configured properly, your app should start running on the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, as long as your emulator or simulator is correctly set up.
